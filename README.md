# Cirkel - Back-end
Welcome to the back-end of Cirkel, our application to the 2017 edition of Europe's largest hackathon, **Junction** (https://hackjunction.com).

Cirkel is the app that connects you and the people around you, using the power of music. 
Cirkel shows you what songs the people close to you are listening to on spotify, and will share your music with the people close to you.
The attributes of these songs will determine your colour. Watch as your colour changes when you meet more people.
The final product is available at https://cirkelapp.com

The back-end was written in Django, using the REST framework to communicate with the front-end, which you can check here: https://github.com/sebastianjvf/junction-spotify-front

Our team existed of @ProLoD, @LordBrolex, @sebastianjvf, Sanne Jelink and @tobiascornille.
